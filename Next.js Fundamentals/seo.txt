How SEO Works

There are four main pillars of SEO:

1. Technical SEO
    Ensures your website is crawlable and indexable by search engines. It's equivalent to the foundation of a house - all other SEO must be built upon good technical SEO first or the plan will not be effective.
        - Search engines must easily access site
        - Pages must load quickly and be mobile-friendly
        - Structure like URLs, routing, etc must be neat and easy to navigate

        Actionable Steps:
            - Use Google Search Console: Add your site and submit an XML sitemap to help Google crawl your Pages

            - Check for Crawl Errors: Fix any errors in Google Search Console such  as 404 Not Found or blocked resource issues 

            - Improve page speed via tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or GTMetrix. Compress images, minify CSS/JS files and enable browser caching

            - Use HTTPS and ensure your site is secure

            - Make it mobile friendly through the use of responsive design and mobile-first approach to ensure your site works well on phones/tablets.



2. On-Page SEO
    This focuses on optimizing content and ensuring your page targets specific keywords or topics.
        - Keywords: the phrases people search for on search engines
        - Meta Titles and Descriptions: appear in search results and affect click-through rate
        - Content Quality: content must be valuable, relevant and easy to read

        Actionable Steps:
            - Do keyword research through tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs or Ubersuggest. The goal is to find keywords with good search volume and low competition.

            - Optimize Title Tags and Meta Descriptions: Keep titles under 60 characters and include the main keywords. For meta descriptions, provide a concise summary with the keyword (under 160 characters)

            - Use headings properly: Use H1 for headings and H2 and H3 for subtopics etc; keep the structure logical (don't skip heading levels)

            - Optimize images through compressing and add alt text to every image

            - Add internal links between your pages (from blog post to your services page) - it helps Google understand the structure of your site


3. Off-Page SEO
    This builds your websites's authority through external factors, mainly backlinks from other reputable sites
        - Backlinks: links from other websites to yours to signal trustworthiness
        - Social Signals: shares and mentions on social media platforms

        Actionable Steps:
            - Guest Blogging: write posts for other relevant websites in exchance for a backlink to your site

            - Get Listed in Directories: submit your site to business directories (such as Google My Business)

            - Monitor Your Backlinks: use tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush to see who's linking to you and disavow bad links

            - Social Media Engagement: share your content across social media platforms

            - Outreach Campaigns: email websites with similar content asking them to link to your posts.

5. User Experience
    Google prioritizes websites that offer the best experience to visitors - it measures this through Core Web Vitals like site speed, mobile usability and content layout stability

    Actionable Steps:
        - Speed up your website through eliminating unused JavaScript and implementing things like lazy loading

        - Core Web Vitals Optimization: focus on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

            LCP: Largest Contentful Paint - measures the time it takes for the main content of a webpage to load and become visible to the user; focuses on the largest content element visible within the viewport (such as images, videos, headings etc 

                Good LCP: 2.5 seconds or less
                Needs Improvement LCP: 2.5 to 4 seconds
                Poor: above 4 seconds

                Optimization techniques for LCP are to compress images, use lazy loading, leverage browser caching and CDNs, prioritizing critical CSS and JS
            
            FID: First Input Delay - measures the time between when a user interacts with your website and when the browser responds to that interaction; FID assesses the responsiveness of page.

                Good FID: 100 ms or less
                Needs Improvement FID: 100 - 300 ms
                Poor FID: above 300 ms

            Optimization techniques include minimizing JS execution time, breaking down long tasks into smaller ones, use code splitting and lazy loading and optimizing 3rd party scripts

                (Code splitting is a technique to improve the performance and loading time of a web app by dividing the code into smaller, manageable chunks. This approach allows you to load only the necessary code for the current page or feature rather than loading the entire application code base at once
                
                Code Splitting Techniques:
                1. Dynamic imports - load modules or components on demand using import() statements

                2. Lazy Loading - load non-critical resources/components only when needed 

                3. Route-Based Splitting: split code based on application routes/pages
                
                4. Component-Based Splitting: split code into smaller components or modules
                )

            CLS: Cumulative Layout Shift - measures the stability of your webpage's layout as it loads; CLS calculates the total amount of layout shift that occurs between the page starts loading 

                Good CLS: 0.1 or less 
                Needs Improvement CLS: 0.1 or 0.25 
                Poor CLS: above 0.25 

                Optimization techniques: reserve space for dynamic content, avoid inserting content above existing content, use aspect ratio boxes for images and videos, avoid using tables for layouts

        - User Clear CTAs - help users find what they need by placing call-to-action buttons and links strategically

        - Monitor Bounce Rate and Dwell Time - use Google Analytics to understand how long users stay on your site - if users leave quickly, revise your content to make it more engaging

        - Add structured Data (schema): use schema markup (e.g. FAQ schema to help Google understand your content better and earn rich results)
