How SEO Works

There are four main pillars of SEO:

1. Technical SEO
    Ensures your website is crawlable and indexable by search engines. It's equivalent to the foundation of a house - all other SEO must be built upon good technical SEO first or the plan will not be effective.
        - Search engines must easily access site
        - Pages must load quickly and be mobile-friendly
        - Structure like URLs, routing, etc must be neat and easy to navigate
