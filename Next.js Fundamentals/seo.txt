How SEO Works

There are four main pillars of SEO:

1. Technical SEO
    Ensures your website is crawlable and indexable by search engines. It's equivalent to the foundation of a house - all other SEO must be built upon good technical SEO first or the plan will not be effective.
        - Search engines must easily access site
        - Pages must load quickly and be mobile-friendly
        - Structure like URLs, routing, etc must be neat and easy to navigate

2. On-Page SEO
    This focuses on optimizing content and ensuring your page targets specfic keywords or topics.
        - Keywords: the phrases people search for on search engines
        - Meta Titles and Descriptions: appear in search results and affect click-through rate
        - Content Quality: content must be valuable, relevant and easy to read
