How SEO Works

There are four main pillars of SEO:

1. Technical SEO
    Ensures your website is crawlable and indexable by search engines. It's equivalent to the foundation of a house - all other SEO must be built upon good technical SEO first or the plan will not be effective.
        - Search engines must easily access site
        - Pages must load quickly and be mobile-friendly
        - Structure like URLs, routing, etc must be neat and easy to navigate

        Actionable Steps:
            - Use Google Search Console: Add your site and submit an XML sitemap to help Google crawl your Pages

            - Check for Crawl Errors: Fix any errors in Google Search Console such  as 404 Not Found or blocked resource issues 

            - Improve page speed via tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or GTMetrix. Compress images, minify CSS/JS files and enable browser caching

            - Use HTTPS and ensure your site is secure

            - Make it mobile friendly through the use of responsive design and mobile-first approach to ensure your site works well on phones/tablets.



2. On-Page SEO
    This focuses on optimizing content and ensuring your page targets specific keywords or topics.
        - Keywords: the phrases people search for on search engines
        - Meta Titles and Descriptions: appear in search results and affect click-through rate
        - Content Quality: content must be valuable, relevant and easy to read

        Actionable Steps:
            - Do keyword research through tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs or Ubersuggest. The goal is to find keywords with good search volume and low competition.

            - Optimize Title Tags and Meta Descriptions: Keep titles under 60 characters and include the main keywords. For meta descriptions, provide a concise summary with the keyword (under 160 characters)

            - Use headings properly: Use H1 for headings and H2 and H3 for subtopics etc; keep the structure logical (don't skip heading levels)

            - Optimize images through compressing and add alt text to every image

            - Add internal links between your pages (from blog post to your services page) - it helps Google understand the structure of your site


3. Off-Page SEO
    This builds your websites's authority through external factors, mainly backlinks from other reputable sites
        - Backlinks: links from other websites to yours to signal trustworthiness
        - Social Signals: shares and mentions on social media platforms

5. User Experience
    Google prioritizes websites that offer the best experience to visitors - it measures this through Core Web Vitals like site speed, mobile usability and content layout stability
