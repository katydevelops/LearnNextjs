Next.js File Structure

Folders at Root of Project
app folder - primarily for routing and UI components 
lib folder - contains reusable utility functions or API clients
components folder - contains reusable React components that can be shared across multiple pages
styles folder - centeralizes global CSS files and reusable style modules
environmental config files - stores environment variables like API keys; exclude from .gitignore
public folder - stores static assets like images, fonts and icons that don't require processing by Webpack
    - public folder items are serverd as is directly to the browser without modification; Wepback doesn't optimize or transform these files
assets folder - since public is not processed by webpack, large imagse that need to be compressed should be put in 
            an assets folder and referenced with Next.js's <Image> component for optimization
pages folder - older process used for handling routing in Pages Router (legacy system before App directory)
