CSS Modules in Next JS

CSS Modules is a CSS file bundling and scope isolation technique that allows you to write CSS code that is scoped for a specific JS module. This means that CSS classes and identifiers are automatically generated and scoped to the specific component or module which eliminates any potential global CSS conflicts.

Next.js provides built-in support for CSS Modules. When you create a CSS file with the same name as your JS/TSX file, but with a module.css extension, Next.js will automatically enable CSS Modules for that file.
