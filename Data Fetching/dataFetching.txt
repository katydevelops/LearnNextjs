Next.js offers three main ways to fetch data:

1. getStaticProps: fetched data at build time; ideal for pages that don't need to be updated frequently aka Static Site Generation (SSG) - since the content is pre-rendered, it's optimized for SEO and loads quickly.

    example:
        export async function getStaticProps(context) [
            const { id } = context.params;
            const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/blog/${id}`);
            const post = await res.json()

            return {
                props: { post }
            }
        ]

2. getServerSideProps: fetched data at each request; ideal for pages that need fresh data on every visit

3. Client-Side Fetching: fetch data after the initial page load; ideal for user-interactive elements where data doesn't need to be rendered on the server (i.e. fetching comments or search results)
