Client-Side Data fetching

PROS 
    DYNAMIC DATA UPDATES
        - Client-side fetching allows data to be updated dynamically without reloading the page. This is great for interactive applications where the data might change frequently - like chat apps and dashboards

    REDUCED INITIAL LOAD TIME
        - The initial page load might be faster because the data is fetched after the page is rendered, leading to a quicker first paint

    USER-SPECIFIC DATA
        - Client-side fetching is useful when you need to fetch data that is specific to the user's session - like personalized content that changes based on the users interactions
