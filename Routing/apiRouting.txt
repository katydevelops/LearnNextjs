API Routes (App Directory)

API routes allow you to create endpoints to handle server-side logic and interact with databases or external APIs. API routes are typically used for backend operations, such as handling form submissions or fetching data that the frontend components need.

With Next.js's new App Directory, routing and data fetching are more integrated with React Server Components. The app directory structure is designed to work seamlessly with server-side logic and React's new features.

To create API routes:
    - use the "app/api" folder structure
    - inside this API folder, create a relevant subdirectory name of your choice
    - then inside, create the "route.tsx" route file 
        **** this "route" file name matters! This file naming convention will tell Next.js that this file is defined as an API route
