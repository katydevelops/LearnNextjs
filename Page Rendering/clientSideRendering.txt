Client Side Page Rendering (CSR )

Traditional React components are rendered on the client side in the browser. 

    The browser initially receives a minimal HTML page (usually just a shell with some Javascript links). 

    Server components allow you to build part of your app's UI on the server - this is super powerful because it lets you take advantage of server-side benefits like fetching data directly from the source, keeping sensitive information secure and reducing the load on the client's browser.
