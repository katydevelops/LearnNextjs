Client Side Page Rendering (CSR )

Traditional React components are rendered on the client side in the browser. 

    The browser initially receives a minimal HTML page (usually just a shell with some Javascript links). The server sends this minimal HTML file and then the Javascript on the client builds and updates the DOM based on the data it fetches. 

    The browser downloads the Javascript file ('bundle.js) - this file contains all the code needed to build the UI using the virtual DOM - the JS the n creates the virtual DOM which is used to update the real DOM. It populates the '<div id="root"></div>' with the actual UI.


    CSR Rendering File Example:

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div> <!-- A placeholder for the app -->
        <script src="bundle.js"></script> <!-- Loads the app's JavaScript -->
    </body>
    </html>


    PROS
    Client Side Rendering is great for highly interactive apps where the UI changes frequently. This is also great for dynamic content as the client can fetch and display new data while reloading the page. 

    CONS
    SEO Challenges: search engines struggle to index content because the initial HTML is minimal and content is generated by Javascript. 

    Performance: The initial load can be slower because the browser has to download and execute JS before displaying anything meaningful.
